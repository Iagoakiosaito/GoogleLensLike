# GoogleLensLike
Study project to construct Google-Lens like.

This project was originally going to use the **Firebase Cloud solution for image labeling**, but I came across a big problem: the Cloud solution would need to be in the paid plan, wich i don't want to put my personal info, for now... So i used the in-device ML image labeling, this aproach was A LOT less powerful, giving most of the times, the wrong label, but that what i have at the moment.

I made this project because i want to learn more about the Firebase tools, which my review to then is: i liked.
